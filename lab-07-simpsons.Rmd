```

Your answer;
obs 1314 var 3

3.  

```{r number_variables}
names(Whickham)
```

Your answer: there are 3 variables outcome

```{r var_type}
ggplot(Whickham, aes(x = outcome)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Your answer: 

```{r plot_outcome}
ggplot(Whickham, aes(x = smoker)) +
  geom_bar()
```

ggplot(Whickham, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_bar()
```
